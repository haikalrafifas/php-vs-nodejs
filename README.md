Welcome to the PHP vs. NodeJS comparison repository! This project aims to explore the performance and developer experience of PHP and NodeJS when handling concurrent requests. As you may be aware, PHP is a single-threaded and synchronous process, while NodeJS is known for its asynchronous and non-blocking I/O capabilities.

## Summary

### Performance:

After conducting rigorous load testing, we observed that NodeJS with ExpressJS outperforms Nginx with ReactPHP in handling high concurrent requests. However, it's worth noting that Nginx and ReactPHP proved to be lightweight, utilizing fewer resources and storage when idling, compared to NodeJS with ExpressJS.

### Developer Experience:

Based on the results, we can summarize the developer experience as follows:

1. If you prefer a holistic JavaScript environment and prioritize high-performance handling of concurrent requests, then NodeJS with ExpressJS is the recommended choice.

2. If you prefer PHP as a backend language but still desire non-blocking, event-driven features similar to NodeJS, then a combination of Nginx and ReactPHP offers an attractive solution.

## The Challenge

PHP's single-threaded nature can become a bottleneck when dealing with multiple concurrent requests, leading to potential performance issues. On the other hand, NodeJS's event-driven, non-blocking I/O model can provide efficient handling of concurrent requests.

## Load Testing Results

To evaluate and compare the performance of PHP and NodeJS in handling concurrent requests, we conducted rigorous load testing. The results of these tests can be found in the [examples](./examples) directory.
